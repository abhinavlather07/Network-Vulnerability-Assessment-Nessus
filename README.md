This project has been carried on Kali Linux in a virtual environment.
The tool which was used is Nessus:Essentials.
This is a very useful tool which takes IP addresses to be scanned for vulnerabilities as inputs.
Gives a list of vulnerabilities as output along with the critical level.
We can generate a report according to the IP address and get the solutions inside it for different vulnerablities.
