Here are the project related details on Network Vulnerability assessment project done as a cybersecurity intern at ExtionInfotech.
The project was done with the help of "Nessus essentials" a very famous tool for vulnerabilty assessment with the help of which we can conduct various types of scans.
We conducted basic network vulnerability test with two IP addresses in which we found different kind of vulnerabilities at various levels such as medium and critical level.
The whole project was done on kali linux operatind system which is best suitable for a virtual environment.
The steps for comprehensive vulnerability assessment include:
Downloading nessus essentials deb file on kali linux using firefox browser.
After installing the nessus software we run the service using the command: /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service
Then go to https://kali:8834/ on firefox.
Run a new scan of any kind and wait for the scan to be completed.
It may take a while for the scan to be complete.
After the scan is complete you can have a look at the vulnerabilities found.
Generate a report in pdf or html format which has details of all the vulnerabilities related to all the IP addresses we entered.
